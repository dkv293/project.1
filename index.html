    <h2>Fire Proof Fire Fighting Robot and Drone Monitoring System Using VR Headset</h2>
    <h3>.INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Fire fighting is a high-risk job where the personnel 
        need to response instantly and work in unsafe 
        surroundings. Traditional fire fighting methods 
        specifically in industrial sector or confined areas, 
        carries an element of risk to human lives. This paper 
        describes the design and development of a fire 
        fighting robot that can withstand high temperatures 
        as well also allows remote operation so it is 
        differentiated from other existing technologies with 
        respect to both its envisaged operating conditions 
        (i.e. survival in extreme heat) are required/cease 
        possible, practical requirements or limitations this 
        puts on three operational properties, glass teams Fire resistance. The robot comes with VR (virtual 
        reality) command system and is fireproof. The 
        system allows firefighters to control the robot from 
        further away and view its live footage through VR 
        headsets, with which they can also manipulate the 
        bot. By immersing the operator of the robot has 
        the opportunity to perform within the contours of 
        the robot’s surroundings due to the VR headset, 
        which allows for basic operations to assist in an 
        effective control of the robot during hostile 
        environments.
        Since the implementation of fire-proof materials 
        as well as Virtual reality, the robot durability and 
        efficiency has improved massively and at the 
        same time boosting the safety of firefighting 
        operations. This research intends to prove how 
        such a robot can be put into practical use, how it 
        would help in mitigating the threats to firefighters 
        and enhance fire suppression initiatives. The 
        output from the present study will be useful for 
        developing more smarter robotic system in 
        upcoming years.</p> 
        <h3>. Literature review</h3>
        <p>2.1 Terrestrial Robots: All-terrain vehicles fitted 
            with sensors and imaging equipment that 
            enables it to ride through and assess a 
            dangerous situation(Bogue, 2021). <br>
            2.2 Remote Sensing: Drones equipped with 
            cameras and thermal infrared imagers which 
            provide an efficient means for remote 
            monitoring of wide areas for the detection of 
            fire and spread of fire surveillance(Akhloufi
            etal ,2018) (Xiuping, 2019). <br>
            2.3 Interactive VR fire training systems will allow 
            the trainees to interact with dynamic fire 
            scenes, giving a realistic feel to the trainees 
            and better outcomes in learning. Such systems 
            apply advanced visualization techniques to 
            achieve lifelike fire scenes while improving 
            the overall effect of the training (Binbin et al., 
            2017). <br>
            2.4 Carbon fiber fabrics can be mixed with fire-
            resistant materials, achieving a mechanical 
            strength along with flame retardation effects. 
            These These fabrics can bear up to a temperature 
            of 1,700- 2,200 °C thus making them suitable for 
            wear in firefighting clothing and other protective 
            wears (Jeongsim, 2021) (Sim, 2021).<br>
            2.5 Autoclaved fiber cement has carbon fiber which 
            enhances the initial strength but causes severe 
            degradation in the post-fire stage. Compressive 
            strength goes as low as 66.7% (Veliseicik et al., 
            2023).<br>
            2.6 Ceramic foams have lesser values of apparent 
            thermal conductivity. This makes them a suitable 
            candidate for fire retardance (Coquard et al., 
            2012).<br>
            2.7 It is crucial to understand their performance at 
            high temperatures as the mode of heat transfer 
            changes from conduction to radiation, which 
            needs advanced models for predicting with 
            accuracy (Coquard et al., 2012).<br>
            2.8 Some robots spray water or dry powder to alter 
            different types of fire conditions to provide better 
            efficiency of extinguishing the fire and minimize 
            risks to the firefighters (Piao et al., 2019). <br>
            2.9 imaging and laser radar equipped drones will 
            autonomously scout fire scenes, creating 
            situational awareness and enhancing the accuracy 
            of reconnaissance (Yongsheng et al., 2020</p>
            <h3> Carbon Fiber</h3>
            <p>Carbon fiber has very high strength to weight 
                ratio is very high heat resistance and withstand 
                temperatures around 1000°C where as the normal 
                fire temperatures is about 700°C to 1000°C</p>
